Dear ChiPro,

  

I am a masters student at the University of Manchester School of Materials Science. I am currently conducting a study on developing bio-mass based textiles.

  

I am contacting to ask if you have any textile products using your ChiPro fibres which I could use within my research.

  

As part of this project, I aim to develop Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for innovative bio-textile materials to evaluate their mechanical, comfort, and sustainability performance.

  

To ensure accuracy and traceability, physical samples will be tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Beyond contributing to your company’s DPP development, the research aims to generate valuable comparative data supporting a broader shift toward sustainable biomass-derived textile products.

  

Planned analyses include tensile strength, abrasion resistance, thermal stability, breathability, biodegradability, and detailed SEM/XRD imaging.

  

If you are open to this, it would be helpful to know:

  

1. Whether sample supply is available for academic research,

2. Any costs or shipping charges involved,

3. The appropriate shipping address and handling requirements,

4. Any NDAs, MTAs, or usage restrictions required,

5. Technical datasheets or documentation you can share (composition, processing, certification).

  

I would be glad to share a summary of the results or include an acknowledgement in the final report if desired. Attached below is the project plan and proposal with further details.

  

Thank you very much for your time and consideration — I look forward to any opportunity to collaborate or support your material development efforts.

  

Warm regards,

### Response

Dear Asa,

thank you for sharing your project plan and for considering ChiPro fibres in your research. We’re happy to support your **DPP-oriented test campaign** with **small academic samples**, provided a simple **Material Transfer Agreement** is in place (academic use only, no onward transfer, and pre-review of any publication/figures where ChiPro is named).

**Sample availability:**

- Staple fibre (e.g., ~2.8 cm): 100–200 g
    
- Trial yarn (~10 m)
    
- 1–2 fabric swatches (~20×20 cm)
    

**Costs & shipping:**  
Samples free of charge; **shipping/customs at cost** (we can ship from Germany; non-commercial “test samples” declaration).  
**Handling:** dry, room temperature; no special storage required.  
**Docs:** We can share a technical brief (composition/process notes) plus basic certifications available for the inputs.

If this works, please confirm your **shipping address**, your **University contact for the MTA**, and your **target test list** (tensile, Martindale, WVTR, SEM/XRD as in your plan). We’d also appreciate **raw data back** and a draft of your **DPP fields** so we can align with our internal documentation.

Happy to proceed and looking forward to collaborating.

  

Mit freundlichem Gruß / Best regards,

### My Response:

Dear Mr. Breitling,

Thank you very much for your kind response and for your generous offer to support our research with ChiPro fibre samples. I am truly grateful to be able to collaborate with you and for the clarity of the information you have provided.

We would be very pleased to proceed under the terms you outlined. I will arrange for the Material Transfer Agreement through our university’s contracts office and will share the contact details shortly. I will also provide the shipping address and our planned test list (tensile, Martindale, WVTR, and SEM/XRD) once the MTA has been arranged, to ensure alignment with your internal documentation.

I look forward to coordinating the delivery and to sharing our results and DPP drafts with your team in due course. Thank you again for this opportunity and for your support of our work.

All the best,

As a final year student arranging a materials transfer agreement is too lengthy and costly a process and is currently beyond my scope of capabilities.!
