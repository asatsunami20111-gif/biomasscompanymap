They just provide fibres


Dear Felde Fibres,

I am a Master’s student in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Manchester, conducting a research project focused on biomass-based textiles as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-derived materials. The study is supported by the university and supervised by Professor Henry Yi Li, Chair of Textiles.


As part of this project, I aim to develop Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for innovative bio-textile materials to evaluate their mechanical, comfort, and sustainability performance. It would be an honour to include the pioneering work your company is doing with bast fibresin this study.

To ensure accuracy and traceability, physical samples will be tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Beyond contributing to your company’s DPP development, the research aims to generate valuable comparative data supporting a broader shift toward sustainable biomass-derived textile products.

I would like to inquire whether your company could provide l sample(s) of felde fibres for academic testing. Planned analyses include tensile strength, abrasion resistance, thermal stability, breathability, biodegradability, and detailed SEM/XRD imaging.

If you are open to this, it would be helpful to know:

1. Whether sample supply is available for academic research,
    
2. Any costs or shipping charges involved,
    
3. The appropriate shipping address and handling requirements,
    
4. Any NDAs, MTAs, or usage restrictions required,
    
5. Technical datasheets or documentation you can share (composition, processing, certification).
    

I would be glad to share a summary of the results or include an acknowledgement in the final report if desired. Attached below is the project plan and proposal with further details.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration — I look forward to any opportunity to collaborate or support your material development efforts.

Warm regards,

### Response:

Dear Asa,

Thank you very much for your e-mail and interest in our wonderful unique fibres!

Cultivated entirely in Germany with complete traceability to the source farms, Felde Fibres’ hemp, nettle and linen is primarily grown as a secondary crop, allowing farmers to generate additional income while ensuring the production of high-quality fibres. Certifications such as GOTS and OEKOTEX Standard 100 further demonstrate Felde Fibres’ commitment to maintaining the highest standards of quality and sustainability in the textile industry.

It would be our pleasure to support your project. We can currently provide you with our certificates, data sheets, hemp and nettle samples. Linen is currently still in production.

Are you interested in bleached or natural-coloured fibres?

As a first step, please take a look at the attachments and let us know how we can proceed.

We would send the samples free of charge.

Kind regards

Nicole

#### My response:

Dear Nicole and Felde Fibres,

  

Thank you so much for your response! 

  

After looking through the certificates and technical data sheets, I am excited to continue to the next stage of receving and studying the samples.

  

Our fibres of interest would preferably be bleached, as one of the tests will be to determine the wash-fastness of the fibres.

  

The samples should be sent to either the University of Manchester Materials department or my personal address. 

For smaller sample deliveries, the personal address is preferred. You can find it at the end of the emal in bold.

  

Considering the density and nature of the raw fibres, ideal sample size would be around 500 grams in weight, and not exceeding 1kg per sample. 

  

We are greatful for your offer of sending the samples free of charge. Please don't hesitate to send an invoice and shipping receipt to this email once all the details are finalised and samples are on their way, as the department and I plan to cover the shipping costs.

  

Experimental work for the project is scheduled to start on the 10th of November. Ideally the samples would be received before this date. Do not worry if this is not possible however, as the plan is flexible. If an issue does arise please let me know and the timeline can be adjusted accordingly. If delivering the samples before the 10th is more expensive then of course we can cover this on our end as well.

  

Lastly, if you have collaborated with any textile companies/manufacturers/designers in the past or present, it would benefit the project greatly if you could provide any contact details for those companies, or product pages using your fibres. This would help with the DPP development and further analyses of textile uses.

  

  

I look forward to hearing back from you,
