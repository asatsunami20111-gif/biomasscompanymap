Dear Orange Fibre,


I am a Masters student conducting a research project at the University of Manchester school of Materials science, focused on developing biomass-based textiles as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-derived materials.  The study will be conducted with support from the university and supervised by Textiles Chair and Professor Henry Yi Li.

Within this project, we aim to create Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for a selection of innovative bio-textile materials to assess their mechanical, comfort, and sustainability performance. It would be an honour to include the incredible work your company is doing with orange fibres in the study.

To ensure accurate results, physical samples will be tested under controlled laboratory conditions. As such, we hope to not only help the company develop a digital product passport but provide valuable evidence arguing for a global shift towards sustainable bio-mass textile products.

I am writing to inquire whether your company could provide small sample(s) of Orange fibre based fabric swatch (e.g., 10 × 10 cm or 20–50 g, depending on form) for academic testing in our lab. The analysis would include tensile strength, abrasion, thermal stability, breathability, biodegradability, etc. Alongside in depth SEM and XRD imaging and analysis.

If you are open to this, further discourse could involve:

1. Whether sample supply is available for academic research,
    
2. Any costs (or shipping charges) for providing the sample,
    
3. The best shipping address and packaging instructions (temperature, humidity, etc.),
    
4. Any NDAs, MTAs, or usage restrictions required,
    
5. Technical datasheets or documentation you can share (composition, processing, certificates).
    

I’m happy to share a short summary of results or acknowledgement if you require it. Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to any opportunity to collaborate or support your material development. Attached below is the project proposal and plan if you require further information.

Warm regards,

Dear Orange Fibre,
I am a master's student currently researching novel biomass-based textiles at the University of Manchester. 

I have a great deal of interest in exploring your Orange fibres, and would like to conduct some experimental testing to include in my report on bio-mass textiles. I will also produce a DPP (Digital Product Passport) pertaining to the product if so permitted.

The DPP, as I am sure you know, is an essential requirement for any textiles company within the EU by the year 2030, and I was hoping to assist your company in this area by doing the adequate research required and formulating a passport specifically for your company.

If I receive some samples from you I will be conducting the following tests:

- Tensile tests
- Martindale abrasion tests
- Breathability tests
- Moisture absorbency tests
- Scanning Electron Microscope imaging and analysis 
- Fabric touch test for thermal properties
- Further wash tests/XRD scanning and more

If any of this interests you, I would be delighted to arrange a shipment of some samples to the University. I can provide you with all the acquired data and further investigations. I can also provide a project outline if you desire more information. 

The University and I are willing to cover any shipping costs, and can also cover the costs of samples if this is required. 

I really hope to hear back from you soon,

All the best,
Asa Hayatsu

Production Process

The primary process, developed and patented by the Italian company Orange Fiber, involves several stages: 

1. **Waste Collection:** The _pastazzo_, or the pulpy by-product remaining after oranges are juiced (peels, seeds, and residual pulp), is collected from juice processing plants.
2. **Cellulose Extraction:** The waste material is treated with a patented chemical process to separate and extract the cellulose from the other contents.
3. **Fiber Formation (Spinning):** The extracted cellulose is sent to partner facilities (such as the Lenzing Group in Austria) where it is converted into spinnable fibers, often through a lyocell-type process using ionic liquids. This results in a continuous filament or a short, cotton-like fiber.
4. **Yarn Production:** The fibers are spun into yarn. This yarn can be used in its pure form to create 100% orange fiber fabric or blended with other materials like cotton or silk to enhance durability and strength.
5. **Fabric Weaving and Finishing:** The yarn is then woven or knitted into fabric. The final textile can be dyed, printed, and treated with finishing processes, which can include adding the fruit's natural oils (rich in vitamins A, C, and E) through nanotechnology to give the fabric skin-nourishing properties.
