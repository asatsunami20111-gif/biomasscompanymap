Research sample request 
Dear Bio-Lush,

I am a Master’s student in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Manchester, conducting a research project focused on biomass-based textiles as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-derived materials. The study is supported by the university and supervised by Professor Henry Yi Li, Chair of Textiles.

As part of this project, I aim to develop Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for innovative bio-textile materials to evaluate their mechanical, comfort, and sustainability performance. It would be an honour to include the pioneering work your company is doing with Nettle, Hemp hurd and seagrass in this study.

To ensure accuracy and traceability, physical samples will be tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Beyond contributing to General DPP development, the research aims to generate valuable comparative data supporting a broader shift toward sustainable biomass-derived textile products.

I would like to inquire whether your company could provide small sample(s) of ANY Collaborative textile production (e.g., 10 × 10 cm or 20–50 g, depending on form) for academic testing. If not, contact information of previous collaborators with biolush who are developing bio-mass based textiles would also be gladly accepted. Planned analyses include tensile strength, abrasion resistance, thermal stability, breathability, biodegradability, and detailed SEM/XRD imaging.

If you are open to this, it would be helpful to know:

1. Whether sample supply is available for academic research,
    
2. Any costs or shipping charges involved,
    
3. The appropriate shipping address and handling requirements,
    
4. Any NDAs, MTAs, or usage restrictions required,
    
5. Technical datasheets or documentation you can share (composition, processing, certification).
    

I would be glad to share a summary of the results or include an acknowledgement in the final report if desired. 

Thank you very much for your time and consideration — I look forward to any opportunity to collaborate or support your material development efforts.

Warm regards,
