## Justifications:Dear Pyratex,

I am a Master's student at the University of Manchester studying Materials Science and Engineering.

As part of my dissertation I am researching novel biomass-based textiles to explore sustainable alternatives to existing industry standards.

I am greatly interested in including your seaweed-based fibre within my project. I am writing to request a sample shipment to my University so I can conduct a series of experimental tests and analyses on your product, as well as to construct a DPP (Digital Product Passport) if so permitted.

As I'm sure you know, a DPP is required for every textile company by the year 2030 as mandated by the EU. As such, I am offering to help develop the DPP, in exchange for a product sample. 

The sample/s will be subject to the following tests:

- Tensile tests
- Martindale Abrasion tests
- Fabric touch tests
- Air permeability tests
- Moisture management tests
- SEM imaging and analysis

The University has graciously offered to cover any shipping costs required as long as your company can provide some samples to work with. However, if there is no way to acquire samples without compensation, then arrangements can be made.

If further information is required please do not hesitate to contact me or my supervisor, Henry Yi Li (Textiles Chair at University of Manchester). I am readily available at any time to send a project outline which illuminates my intentions further.


I hope to hear back from you soon,
