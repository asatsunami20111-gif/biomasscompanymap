Science-led, long term sustainability through closed-loop cellulose chemistry. Focus on [[Circularity, Close Loop Mindset and Resource Efficiency]]
## Material Goals:
They prioritise Scalability and Manufacturability]] and Process Control for Chemical use and Pollution.

## Sustainability Goals:
Lyocell is produced using FSC certified wood (Net-zero or Lower Fossil Fuel Dependance]]) and they reduce chemical loss through solvent recovery above 99% (Lower Chemical Usage]]).
They reduce water inputs in fibre production.
They achieve climate neutrality across all production site (Net-zero or Lower Fossil Fuel Dependance]])

## Justifications:
- Closed loop NMMO process (Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency]]).
- Integration with pulp mills Economic Transformation for Producers]]. 
- They uphold the Transparency and Consumer Focused]] through publicly reported LCA and decarbonisation strategies.
- They protect forests using strict forestry certifications (Biodiversity and Regenerative Agriculture]]).
