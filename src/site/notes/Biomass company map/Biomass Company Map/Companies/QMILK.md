##### Contacted October 10


### **Subject:** Research sample request — University of Manchester, Department of Materials Science & Engineering

Dear QMILK,

I am a Master’s student in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Manchester, conducting a research project focused on **biomass-based textiles as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-derived materials**. The study is supported by the university and supervised by Professor Henry Yi Li, Chair of Textiles.

As part of this project, I aim to develop **Digital Product Passports (DPPs)** for innovative bio-textile materials to evaluate their **mechanical, comfort, and sustainability performance**. It would be an honour to include the pioneering work your company is doing with waste milk proteins in this study.

To ensure accuracy and traceability, **physical samples will be tested under controlled laboratory conditions**. Beyond contributing to your company’s DPP, the research aims to generate valuable comparative data supporting a broader shift toward sustainable biomass-derived textile products.

I would like to inquire whether your company could provide small **sample(s) of QMILK Textile** and/or felt (e.g., 10 × 10 cm or 20–50 g, depending on form) for academic testing. Planned analyses include **tensile strength, abrasion resistance, thermal stability, breathability, biodegradability, and detailed SEM/XRD imaging.**

If you are open to this, it would be helpful to know:

1. Whether sample supply is available for academic research,
    
2. Any costs or shipping charges involved,
    
3. The appropriate shipping address and handling requirements,
    
4. Any NDAs, MTAs, or usage restrictions required,
    
5. Technical datasheets or documentation you can share (composition, processing, certification).
    

I would be glad to share a summary of the results or include an acknowledgement in the final report if desired. Attached below is the project plan and proposal with further details.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration — I look forward to any opportunity to collaborate or support your material development efforts.

Warm regards,

QMILK is based on the polymer milk protein
casein.
The casein is manufactured from raw milk,
that is no longer capable of consumption
and according to legal regulations can’t be
used as food.
Although this discarded milk is no longer
suitable for consumption, it still contains
very valuable ingredients and is a very
precious commodity, which has great
potential for technical purposes.
We are working on the construction of the
first logistics system for collecting unused,
not consumptable milk to a zero waste
process from raw material up to the
final product.

Indian version has noted concerns:
## **Understanding the Environmental Impact of Milk Fabric**

  

Milk cotton fabric, also known as casein fabric, can have varying effects on the environment depending on how it's produced.

  

**_Historical Concerns_**_:_ In the past, some forms of milk cotton fabric were manufactured using formaldehyde, a harmful neurotoxin that can harm ecosystems. Thankfully, modern production methods have moved away from this toxic substance, and it's unlikely that manufacturers still use it.

  

**_Acrylonitrile Blend:_** However, milk cotton fabric made with acrylonitrile, though better than formaldehyde, isn't considered truly sustainable. Acrylic textiles, which often include acrylonitrile, are challenging to recycle and don't decompose. Additionally, acrylonitrile is considered a carcinogen and mutagen, posing health risks to both textile workers and consumers.

  

Improper disposal of acrylonitrile used in production can also harm the environment. Moreover, it can take a significant amount of milk to create a small amount of milk fiber, potentially leading to wasteful practices. The exact amount of milk required for production can vary depending on the process used.

  

**_Sustainability Aspects_**: On the bright side, milk fabric can be sustainable when produced using eco-friendly methods. It is made from a renewable resource, milk, and is biodegradable. Compared to fabrics like cotton and polyester, milk fabric production generally requires less water and energy.
