**BANANATEX®** is a pioneering **biodegradable, plant-based technical fabric** made entirely from **Abacá banana plant fibres** — the first of its kind to offer a durable, performance-oriented alternative to conventional synthetic textiles like polyester. It was developed by the Swiss brand **QWSTION** in collaboration with Taiwanese yarn and weaving specialists, launching in **October 2018** with a mission to challenge plastic-based materials.

## **Company Ethos & Core Values**

BANANATEX® embodies a **responsibility-driven ethos** focused on environmental health, social benefit, and circular design:

### **Environmental Responsibility**

- The fabric is **plastic-free, biodegradable and compostable**, designed to return safely to the earth at end-of-life rather than persist as waste.
    

Abacá is grown **without pesticides, fertilizers, or extra water**, thriving with natural rainfall, which minimizes ecological impact and promotes biodiversity.

It contributes to **reforestation in parts of the Philippines** previously cleared for logging, helping restore ecosystems.

### **Social & Economic Impact**

- BANANATEX® supports **stable livelihoods for small-scale farmers** by cultivating Abacá in regenerative permaculture systems.
    

The company promotes **transparency and partnership** with like-minded brands to advance responsible material use across industries.

### **Circularity & Transparency**

- The material adheres to **Cradle to Cradle principles**, certified to **Cradle to Cradle® Gold**, meaning it is designed for safe and circular use.
    

It is **bio-compostable in industrial environments and marine settings**, emphasizing end-of-life return to nature rather than landfill.

## **Material Goals**

BANANATEX® aims to:

-  **Replace synthetic fabrics** like polyester and nylon with a plant-based alternative.

  
-  **Maintain performance** — strength, durability, UV resistance, breathability — while being sustainable.  
- **Ensure full lifecycle responsibility** — from regenerative agriculture to biodegradation or composting.  
- **Promote collaboration** — it’s shared with partners rather than kept proprietary, encouraging wider adoption of sustainable materials.

##  **Product & Material Details**

###  **Material Composition**

- 100% **Abacá banana plant fibres** — naturally strong and breathable.
    

Optionally coated with **beeswax or plant-based coatings** for added water resistance (evolving toward fully vegan certification).

### **Performance Characteristics**

- **Durable & technical:** comparable to cotton canvas with higher strength and tear resistance.
    

**Breathable and fast-drying**, making it suitable for bags, accessories, outdoor gear, and potentially apparel.

**Naturally antibacterial**, UV resistant, and odor resistant due to its plant-derived structure.

###  **Production Process (Simplified)**

1. **Cultivation & Harvest:** Abacá grows in permaculture systems without intensive inputs.
    

**Fibre Extraction:** Leaves/stalks are separated manually — fibres are combed, air-dried, and bundled.

**Processing:** Fibres are boiled/pressed into sheets, turned into pulp, cut into strips, then **spun into yarn**.

- **Weaving & Dyeing:** Yarn is dyed using sustainable, Oeko-Tex® Standard-certified processes and woven at high density.
    

**Finishing:** A wax or plant-based coating can be applied for water resistance.

## **Certifications & Recognition**

- **Cradle to Cradle® Gold Certification** — among the highest standards for sustainable product design.
    

Often showcased with awards in design and sustainability circles (e.g., German Sustainability Award, Green Product Award).

Recognized for innovation in vegan and cruelty-free textiles.
