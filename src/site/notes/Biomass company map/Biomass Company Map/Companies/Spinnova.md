Cellulose microfibrils into fibres through mechanical spinning.
## 
- "Lowest impact textile fibre in history" - minimal chemistry and circularity
- [[End-of-Life Recyclability or Biodegradability]]
- [[Climate Mitigation, Pollution and Chemical Reduction]]


## Material Goals
- Process Control for Chemical use and Pollution]]
- Biodegradability and recyclability]]
- 
## Sustainability Goals
- Eliminate harmful chemical inputs (Lower Chemical Usage]])
- Reduce energy and water use drastically (Reduced Water and Energy Footprints]])
- Enable full recyclability back to pulp Responsible End of Life Management or Full recyclability]]
