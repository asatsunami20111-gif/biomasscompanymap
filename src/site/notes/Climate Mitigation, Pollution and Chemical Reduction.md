## Ethos - Significant focus on sustainable goals, in particular emissions, fossil fuels, water usage and chemical usage

Substituting petrochemical fibres, valorising waste, and using low-energy biological processes reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

Less microplastics, fewer toxic finishing chemicals, and reduced dye/bleach loads in some routes.

## Companies who share this ethos:
[[Lenzing]] – Decarbonisation roadmap; chemical reduction in viscose/lyocell.

[[Spinnova]] – Zero toxic chemicals; low water & energy use.

[[Keel Labs]] – Eliminates synthetics/microplastics.

[[DESSERTO]], [[Vegea]], [[Appleskin]] – Alternative to PVC leather & polyurethane-heavy synthetics.

[[Ecovative]], [[MycoWorks]], [[MOGU]] – Replace tanning, foams & plastics.

[[Ananas Anam]], [[Orange Fibre]] – Reduce pollution from both leather and food waste.

[[SOS Carbon]]– Algae harvesting for atmospheric carbon drawdown.


[[BioPuff]] – Plastic-free insulation reduces synthetic emissions.
