## Ethos

Most explicitly aim to replace linear take-make-waste models with closed loops (waste feedstocks → new fibres → compost/reuse). This is in line with the EU's ciruclar product directives and with the end goals of a circular economy.

Using residual biomass reduces waste streams, creates higher value products from existing materials, and can support local circular systems

## Companies who share this Ethos:


[[Lenzing]] – Closed-loop lyocell chemistry (>99% solvent recovery).

[[Spinnova]] – Mechanical fibre creation without dissolution → full recyclability into pulp.

[[Infinited]] – Fibre-to-fibre recycling → Infinna™ cellulose recycling loop.

[[Future Materials]] – Repository for circular biomaterials.

[[My-Fi]] – Mycelium manufacturing compatible with circular waste streams.

[[MycoWorks]], [[Ecovative]], [[MOGU]] – Mycelium grown on circular agro-waste.

[[Frumat]], [[Vegea]], [[Appleskin]] – Resource efficiency through upcycled fruit waste.
